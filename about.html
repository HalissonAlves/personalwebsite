    <h2 class="container__title">About Me</h2>
    <p class="container__paragraph">I am a Front-end Developer with 4 years of programming experience living in <span
        class="container__paragraph--mustard">Brazil</span>. I've worked mainly with <span
        class="container__paragraph--darkBlue">Angular</span>
      and <span class="container__paragraph--darkBlue">Ionic Framework</span> in my corporative jobs along these years.
      For my clients and side projects I love to use <span class="container__paragraph--darkBlue">React</span> and <span
        class="container__paragraph--darkBlue">React
        Native</span>. Feel free to check some of them in my portfolio section and GitHub page. I love to learn new
      things and work in challenging projects, and I believe that the
      keys to be a great developer are <span class="container__paragraph--lightBlue">adaptability</span> and <span
        class="container__paragraph--lightBlue">cooperation</span>.
